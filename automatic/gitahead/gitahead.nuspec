    <summary>GitAhead is a graphical Git client designed to help you understand and manage your source code history</summary>
    <description><![CDATA[GitAhead is a graphical Git client for Windows, Linux and macOS. It features a fast native interface designed to help you understand and manage your source code history.

GitAhead was designed by SciTools™, the makers of Understand™. It has all of the features you expect from a commercial quality client, now completely free and open source.

Git provideds a wealth of historical information that, too often, goes unexploited because it's cumbersome to explore with other tools. We believe that when you understand your history you'll make better choices today!
