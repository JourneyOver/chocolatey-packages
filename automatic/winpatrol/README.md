WinPatrol alerts you to hijackings, malware attacks and critical changes made to your computer without your permission. As a multipurpose support utility, WinPatrol replaces multiple system utilities with its enhanced functionality.

WinPatrol was the pioneer in using a heuristic behavioral approach to detecting attacks and violations of your computing environment.

WinPatrol takes snapshots of your critical system resources and alerts you to any changes that occur without your knowledge.
