Jackett works as a proxy server: it translates queries from apps ([Sonarr](https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr), [Radarr](https://github.com/Radarr/Radarr), [SickRage](https://sickrage.github.io/), [CouchPotato](https://couchpota.to/), [Mylar](https://github.com/evilhero/mylar), etc) into tracker-site-specific http queries, parses the html response, then sends results back to the requesting software. This allows for getting recent uploads (like RSS) and performing searches. Jackett is a single repository of maintained indexer scraping and translation logic - removing the burden from other apps.
