    <description><![CDATA[nuclear is a free music streaming program that pulls content from free sources all over the internet.

If you know [mps-youtube](https://github.com/mps-youtube/mps-youtube), this is a similar music player but with a GUI.
It's also focusing more on audio. Imagine Spotify which you don't have to pay for and with a bigger library.

## Features

- Searching for and playing music from youtube (including integration with playlists), bandcamp (including albums), and soundcloud
- Searching for related songs in youtube
- Downloading from youtube
- Searching for albums (powered by last.fm and musicbrainz), album view, automatic song lookup based on artist and track name (in progress, can be dodgy sometimes)
- Song queue, which can be exported as a playlist
- Loading saved playlists (stored in json files)
- Scrobbling to last.fm (along with updating the 'now playing' status)
- Newest releases with reviews - tracks and albums
- Browsing by genre
