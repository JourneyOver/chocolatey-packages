WinPatrol alerts you to hijackings, malware attacks and critical changes made to your computer without your permission. As a multipurpose support utility, WinPatrol replaces multiple system utilities with its enhanced functionality.

WinPatrol takes snapshots of your critical system resources and alerts you to any changes that occur without your knowledge.
