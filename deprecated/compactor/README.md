With modern lightweight compression algorithms running at gigabytes per second per core, it's practically a no-brainer to apply them to filesystems to make better use of storage and IO.

Half-recognising this, Windows 10 ships with a reworked compression system that, while fast and effective, is only exposed to users via a command-line tool - [`compact.exe`].

Compactor is here to plug that gap, with a simple GUI utility anyone can use.
