    <description>
At times there may be a reason you need to have your IP address set to static. A static IP is an IP address that never changes. By default peoples IP is dynamic which means it can change at any time. When port forwarding you forward to your local IP address, and if your IP changes your port forwarding will no longer work as it is not pointing to your new IP. This is the same for nearly all settings in a router that points to your computer, such as DMZ and logging. So to keep that from happening you need to set your IP to static so it never changes, then you no longer have to worry about your IP changing. (This should be done for computers behind a router) The process to set your IP can be intimidating if you have never done it before, that's why we provide this program to you, to make it simple.
